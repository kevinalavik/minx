# STATUS

Current phase: 2 (CPU core) — phase 1 VERIFIED

## Phases
| # | Phase | State | Evidence / command |
|---|-------|-------|--------------------|
| 1 | Toolchain & boot, framebuffer console | VERIFIED | `make test` → 9/9 PASS, framebuffer dump captured; `make run` boots to a graphical console at 1280x800 with 160x50 text cells. Serial log shows the memory map, RSDP, `SMP: 4 CPUs`, initrd and heap. Panic path verified separately (register dump + stack trace on both consoles) while fixing bring-up bugs. |
| 2 | CPU core, keyboard into console | NOT STARTED | |
| 3 | Memory | NOT STARTED | |
| 4 | SMP | NOT STARTED | |
| 5 | Scheduler & kernel threads | NOT STARTED | |
| 6 | Userspace entry | NOT STARTED | |
| 7 | Processes, signals, pipes | NOT STARTED | |
| 8 | VFS + ramfs + initrd + devfs | NOT STARTED | |
| 9 | TTY + libc + sh | NOT STARTED | |
| 10 | Coreutils + procfs | NOT STARTED | |
| 11 | Hardening / stress | NOT STARTED | |
| 12 | Polish | NOT STARTED | |

## What exists today
- **Boot**: Limine 12.9.1, hybrid BIOS+UEFI ISO, higher-half kernel at
  `0xffffffff80000000`. Memory map, framebuffer, RSDP, MP info and the initrd
  module are all taken from the bootloader's responses.
- **Console**: own framebuffer renderer (`kernel/drivers/fb.c`) plus an
  ANSI/VT100 terminal (`kernel/drivers/console.c`) with SGR colours, 24-bit
  colour, bold/inverse attributes, scrolling regions, cursor movement and
  erase. Everything is mirrored byte-for-byte to COM1.
- **Font**: the 8x16 `lat9-16.psf` from the Linux `kbd` package, converted to a
  C array at build time by `tools/psf2c.py`. No font scaling: a 1280x800
  framebuffer yields a 160x50 terminal.
- **CPU core**: GDT (ring 0/3 + 64-bit TSS), TSS with IST stacks for #DF and
  NMI, IDT with all 32 exceptions plus the 16 legacy IRQ vectors, and an
  exception reporter that decodes page-fault error codes and dumps registers
  and a stack trace to both consoles.
- **Panic**: prints the message, a full GPR dump and a kernel stack trace, then
  writes 1 to QEMU's isa-debug-exit port so the harness sees a crash.
- **Allocator**: first-fit free list with coalescing over regions handed to it
  explicitly. A 4 MiB static arena is attached at boot; the PMM will attach the
  rest of RAM in phase 3.
- **Self tests**: nine in-kernel checks (`minx.test=1`) plus a host-compiled
  allocator fuzz test (`make test-host`).

## Known bugs / gaps
- Only the boot CPU is running. No ACPI parsing, no LAPIC/IOAPIC, no PIC
  remap, no timer interrupts, so interrupts are effectively unusable so far.
  (Phase 2.)
- The framebuffer resolution is whatever Limine picks (1280x800 under QEMU
  here); the `resolution:` option in `boot/limine.conf` is not honoured by the
  BIOS path, so the console adapts to whatever arrives.
- The initrd is unpacked by nothing yet: it is loaded and its size is reported,
  but phase 8 writes the ramfs unpacker.
- The TSC frequency could not be detected from CPUID under KVM here, so
  `delay_ms()` falls back to assuming 1 GHz. Delays are therefore a minimum,
  never shorter than requested. Phase 2 should take the frequency from the
  LAPIC/PIT instead.
- `make run` opens a GUI window; automated verification uses `make test`, which
  is always headless.

## Needs human decision
(none yet)

## Test commands
```
make test        # headless boot, in-kernel self tests, framebuffer dump; non-zero on failure
make test-host   # host-compiled allocator fuzz test (fast, no QEMU)
make run         # graphical console in a QEMU window (SMP=4 MEM=512M by default)
GUI=0 make run   # headless: serial console only
make debug       # boot paused for GDB (tools/gdb-run.sh drives it in batch)
sh tools/shot.sh build/minx.iso /tmp/shot.ppm 10   # screenshot the framebuffer
```

## Push status
Pushing has been attempted after each verified phase; see the notes at the
bottom of the git log for the outcome of the last attempt.
